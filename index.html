<p class = "facts"> <strong> Thirteen Ways Of Looking At A Blackbird</strong></p>
<p><em>By</em> <em>Wallace Stevens</em></p>
<blockquote>
<strong>I</strong><br>
Among twenty snowy mountains,/   
The only moving thing/  
Was the eye of the blackbird.<br>  

<strong>II</strong><br>
I was of three minds,/   
Like a tree/   
In which there are three blackbirds.<br>  

<strong>III</strong><br>
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds./   
It was a small part of the pantomime.<br>

<strong>IV</strong><br>
A man and a woman/  
Are one./
A man and a woman and a blackbird/   
Are one.<br>

<strong>V</strong><br>
I do not know which to prefer,/  
The beauty of inflections/  
Or the beauty of innuendoes,/  
The blackbird whistling/  
Or just after.<br>

<strong>VI</strong><br>
Icicles filled the long window/   
With barbaric glass./  
The shadow of the blackbird/   
Crossed it, to and fro./   
The mood/  
Traced in the shadow/  
An indecipherable cause.<br> 

<strong>VII</strong><br>
O thin men of Haddam,/  
Why do you imagine golden birds?/   
Do you not see how the blackbird/  
Walks around the feet/
Of the women about you?<br>

<strong>VIII</strong><br>
I know noble accents/ 
And lucid, inescapable rhythms;/   
But I know, too,/   
That the blackbird is involved/   
In what I know.<br>

<strong>IX</strong><br>
When the blackbird flew out of sight,/ 
It marked the edge/  
Of one of many circles.<br>

<strong>X</strong><br>
At the sight of blackbirds   
Flying in a green light,   
Even the bawds of euphony   
Would cry out sharply.<br>  

<strong>XI</strong><br>
He rode over Connecticut/  
In a glass coach./  
Once, a fear pierced him,/ 
In that he mistook/ 
The shadow of his equipage/  
For blackbirds.<br> 

<strong>XII</strong><br>
The river is moving./   
The blackbird must be flying.<br>  

<strong>XIII</strong><br>
It was evening all afternoon./   
It was snowing/   
And it was going to snow./   
The blackbird sat/  
In the cedar-limbs.<br>
